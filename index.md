## Hosting Images on S3 using Symfony

In this example, the bucket name is 'your-bucket-name', and the files are stored under the 'uploads' folder.

### Create an S3 bucket

Create an S3 bucket and add the following policy:
```
{
    "Version": "2008-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AllowPublicRead",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "*"
            },
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/uploads/*"
        }
    ]
}
```

This policy allows public read of the files under uploads, so that they can be displayed on the website.

### Create an IAM user

Go to aws and create an IAM user. copy the key and secret and set it to your .env
Allow S3 read and write access to the S3 bucket by adding the following custom policy:
```
{
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::*"
    },
    {
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name",
        "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
